    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you will write a generative model based on the paper [*Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004) by Isola et al. 2017, also known as Pix2Pix.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be training a model that can convert aerial satellite imagery (\"input\") into map routes (\"output\"), as was done in the original paper. Since the architecture for the generator is a U-Net, which you've already implemented (with minor changes), the emphasis of the assignment will be on the loss function. So that you can see outputs more quickly, you'll be able to see your model train starting from a pre-trained checkpoint - but feel free to train it from scratch on your own too.\n",

    "\n",
    "<!-- You will take the segmentations that you generated in the previous assignment and produce photorealistic images. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.   Implement the loss of a Pix2Pix model that differentiates it from a supervised U-Net.\n",
    "2.   Observe the change in generator priorities as the Pix2Pix generator trains, changing its emphasis from reconstruction to realism.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- When you're done with this assignment, you'll be able to understand much of [*Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004), which introduced Pix2Pix.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be using the same U-Net as in the previous assignment, but you'll write another discriminator and change the loss to make it a GAN. -->"
