    "You will be training a model that can convert horses into zebras, and vice versa. Once again, the emphasis of the assignment will be on the loss functions. In order for you to see good outputs more quickly, you'll be training your model starting from a pre-trained checkpoint. You are also welcome to train it from scratch on your own, if you so choose.\n",

    "#### Residual Block\n",
    "Perhaps the most notable architectural difference between the U-Net you used for Pix2Pix and the architecture you're using for CycleGAN are the residual blocks. In CycleGAN, after the expanding blocks, there are convolutional layers where the output is ultimately added to the original input so that the network can change as little as possible on the image. You can think of this transformation as a kind of skip connection, where instead of being concatenated as new channels before the convolution which combines them, it's added directly to the output of the convolution. In the visualization below, you can imagine the stripes being generated by the convolutions and then added to the original image of the horse to transform it into a zebra. These skip connections also allow the network to be deeper, because they help with vanishing gradients issues that come when a neural network gets too deep and the gradients multiply in backpropagation to become very small; instead, these skip connections enable more gradient flow. A deeper network is often able to learn more complex features.\n",

    "Here you get to see some of the superbly new material! You'll want to measure the change in an image when you pass the generator an example from the target domain instead of the input domain it's expecting. The output should be the same as the input since it is already of the target domain class. For example, if you put a horse through a zebra -> horse generator, you'd expect the output to be the same horse because nothing needed to be transformed. It's already a horse! You don't want your generator to be transforming it into any other thing, so you want to encourage this behavior. In encouraging this identity mapping, the authors of CycleGAN found that for some tasks, this helped properly preserve the colors of an image, even when the expected input (here, a zebra) was put in. This was particularly useful for the photos <-> paintings mapping and, while an optional aesthetic component, you might find it useful for your applications down the line.\n",
