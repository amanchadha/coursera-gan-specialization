    "### Goals\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to build a Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) that solves some of the stability issues with the GANs that you have been using up until this point. Specifically, you'll use a special kind of loss function known as the W-loss, where W stands for Wasserstein, and gradient penalties to prevent mode collapse.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fun Fact: Wasserstein is named after a mathematician at Penn State, Leonid Vaseršteĭn. You'll see it abbreviated to W (e.g. WGAN, W-loss, W-distance).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "1.   Get hands-on experience building a more stable GAN: Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP).\n",
    "2.   Train the more advanced WGAN-GP model.\n",

    "## Generator and Critic\n",
    "\n",
    "You will begin by importing some useful packages, defining visualization functions, building the generator, and building the critic. Since the changes for WGAN-GP are done to the loss function during training, you can simply reuse your previous GAN code for the generator and critic class. Remember that in WGAN-GP, you no longer use a discriminator that classifies fake and real as 0 and 1 but rather a critic that scores images with real numbers."

    "## Putting It All Together\n",
    "Before you put everything together, there are a few things to note.\n",
    "1.   Even on GPU, the **training will run more slowly** than previous labs because the gradient penalty requires you to compute the gradient of a gradient -- this means potentially a few minutes per epoch! For best results, run this for as long as you can while on GPU.\n",
    "2.   One important difference from earlier versions is that you will **update the critic multiple times** every time you update the generator This helps prevent the generator from overpowering the critic. Sometimes, you might see the reverse, with the generator updated more times than the critic. This depends on architectural (e.g. the depth and width of the network) and algorithmic choices (e.g. which loss you're using). \n",
    "3.   WGAN-GP isn't necessarily meant to improve overall performance of a GAN, but just **increases stability** and avoids mode collapse. In general, a WGAN will be able to train in a much more stable way than the vanilla DCGAN from last assignment, though it will generally run a bit slower. You should also be able to train your model for more epochs without it collapsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Once again, be warned that this runs very slowly on a CPU. One way to run this more quickly is to download the .ipynb and upload it to Google Drive, then open it with Google Colab and make the runtime type GPU and replace\n",
