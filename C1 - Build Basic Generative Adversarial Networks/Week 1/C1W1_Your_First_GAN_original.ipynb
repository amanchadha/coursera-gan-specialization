    "### Goal\n",
    "In this notebook, you're going to create your first generative adversarial network (GAN) for this course! Specifically, you will build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9). You will be using PyTorch in this specialization, so if you're not familiar with this framework, you may find the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) useful. The hints will also often include links to relevant documentation.\n",

    "#### MNIST Dataset\n",
    "The training images your discriminator will be using is from a dataset called [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). It contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits, from 0 to 9, like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MNIST Digits](MnistExamples.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that the images are quite pixelated -- this is because they are all only 28 x 28! The small size of its images makes MNIST ideal for simple training. Additionally, these images are also in black-and-white so only one dimension, or \"color channel\", is needed to represent them (more on this later in the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tensor\n",
    "You will represent the data using [tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html). Tensors are a generalization of matrices: for example, a stack of three matrices with the amounts of red, green, and blue at different locations in a 64 x 64 pixel image is a tensor with the shape 3 x 64 x 64.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are easy to manipulate and supported by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), the machine learning library you will be using. Feel free to explore them more, but you can imagine these as multi-dimensional matrices or vectors!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batches\n",
    "While you could train your model after generating one image, it is extremely inefficient and leads to less stable training. In GANs, and in machine learning in general, you will process multiple images per training step. These are called batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that your generator will generate an entire batch of images and receive the discriminator's feedback on each before updating the model. The same goes for the discriminator, it will calculate its loss on the entire batch of generated images as well as on the reals before the model is updated."

Each block should include a [linear transformation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html) to map to another shape, a [batch normalization](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm1d.html) for stabilization, and finally a non-linear activation function (you use a [ReLU here](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.ReLU.html)) so the output can be transformed in complex ways.

    "Finally, you can put everything together! For each epoch, you will process the entire dataset in batches. For every batch, you will need to update the discriminator and generator using their loss. Batches are sets of images that will be predicted on before the loss functions are calculated (instead of calculating the loss function after each image). Note that you may see a loss to be greater than 1, this is okay since binary cross entropy loss can be any positive number for a sufficiently confident wrong guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s also often the case that the discriminator will outperform the generator, especially at the start, because its job is easier. It's important that neither one gets too good (that is, near-perfect accuracy), which would cause the entire model to stop learning. Balancing the two models is actually remarkably hard to do in a standard GAN and something you will see more of in later lectures and assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've submitted a working version with the original architecture, feel free to play around with the architecture if you want to see how different architectural choices can lead to better or worse GANs. For example, consider changing the size of the hidden dimension, or making the networks shallower or deeper by changing the number of layers.\n",
